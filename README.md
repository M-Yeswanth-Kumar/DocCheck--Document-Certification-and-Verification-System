# Etherdocs: Decentralized Document Management System

## Introduction

**Etherdocs** is a revolutionary **Decentralized Application (DAPP)** that harnesses the power of the Ethereum Blockchain to efficiently manage student documents. This innovative platform streamlines the end-to-end process of both issuing and verifying documents, providing unparalleled authenticity, security, and efficiency. By leveraging cutting-edge Blockchain technology, Etherdocs offers a cost-effective solution for document storage while enabling real-time verification.

### Aims & Objectives

The primary aim of Etherdocs is to establish a **decentralized portal** dedicated to the seamless management and verification of documents with long-term value. The platform's core objectives include:

- Facilitating the verification process to promptly identify forged documents and ensure their authenticity.
- Eliminating the laborious manual steps often involved in document reception and verification, offering faster outcomes.
- Enabling the issuance, verification, and secure storage of various documents within a unified ecosystem.
- Harnessing the power of Blockchain technology and the Ethereum network to significantly reduce the costs associated with cloud storage, all while enhancing security through smart contract implementations.

### Scope of the Project

The implementation of Blockchain technology is a pivotal component within automated management systems for educational institutions. Etherdocs seeks to address the time-consuming nature of retrieving sensitive student information and administrative data for learning and research purposes. The platform's scope encompasses:

- Designing a decentralized system that effectively utilizes blockchain for heightened security and transparency.
- Stakeholders involved in the system: Issuer (university/college), Verifier (employer or higher education institution), and User (recent graduate).
- The project's focal point is the eradication of forged and counterfeit certificates, ensuring the utmost credibility in the document verification process.

## Software and Hardware Setup

The operational environment for Etherdocs entails a combination of software and hardware components:

- Node.js version ^14.19.0 and npm version ^8.5.5 for development and deployment.
- MetaMask wallet integration for facilitating transactions.
- Ethereum cryptocurrency for executing transactions and smart contracts.
- Issuer's official webpage publishing wallet addresses for authentication.
- Modern internet browser (preferably Chrome v80.0) and a stable internet connection for seamless accessibility.
- Metamask browser extension for secure wallet connections.

## Methodology

The operational methodology of Etherdocs is driven by the following key steps:

1. Issuer creates an electronic certificate containing UUID, hash value, and IPFS link.
2. Uploaded certificates are stored on IPFS for easy access by students.
3. Blockchain stores crucial certificate data, including hash values, for streamlined verification.
4. Verifiers utilize hash values to validate document authenticity against stored data.
5. Smart contracts are employed to execute verification processes securely and efficiently.

## Results and Discussion

The successful implementation of Etherdocs showcases its potential to revolutionize document management and verification processes. Key achievements include:

- Intuitive user interface for both document issuance and verification.
- Efficient verification process through the integration of blockchain and IPFS.
- Robust and tamper-proof storage of certificates, enhancing data security.

## Conclusion and Future Work

Etherdocs presents a pioneering solution that addresses the challenges of conventional document management systems. By establishing a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform, Etherdocs ensures the credibility of academic documents while streamlining verification processes. As the platform matures, it holds the potential to reshape academic document management, benefiting students, issuers, and the broader educational landscape. The ongoing evolution of Etherdocs promises to make a lasting impact on the education sector and the broader blockchain community.
